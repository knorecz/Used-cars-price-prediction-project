# Used cars price prediction project

## Project scope
This is final project of the Data Science Career Path at Codecademy. The aim is to find the most suitable model for price prediction of used cars based on the data available on Kaggle.

Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ander289386/cars-germany

The dataset covers vehicles sold in Germany in 2021. Observed attributes are:

  - make
  - model
  - mileage
  - fuel
  - gear
  - offer types
  - price
  - horsepower
  - year

## Objectives
The objective is to build machine learning models to predict price of a car based on it's attributes.

### Used tools
- python
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit learn
- seaborn

### Predictive models

- linear regression
- k neighbors regression
- random forest regression
